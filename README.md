# Kaggle-Titanic-Project
## Introduction
It's the Kaggle Titanic Machine Learning Comepetition code. Its a simple code written in R to predict which passengers survived the shipwreck disaster. I have written commands lor logistic regression and random forest regression with model accuracy of about 80%. My score on Kaggle with this code was 0.75. 
## Getting Started
In the folder I have included the csv files that trains and tests the model. Following is a brief on the files included.

train.csv = File used for training the ML models\
test.csv = File used for the end submission in kaggle\
Titanic.Rmd = It is the markdown file for the R code\
Results.csv = File results for the test.csv file with logistic regression\
rf_results.csv = File results for the test.csv file with random forest regression\

R studio would be required o run the RMD file.
